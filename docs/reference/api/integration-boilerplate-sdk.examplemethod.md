## exampleMethod() function

Method summary - General information about the SDK method, usually a single sentence.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function exampleMethod(props: TODO): Promise<any>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  props | [TODO](./integration-boilerplate-sdk.todo.md) | Just like our API methods, our SDK connector methods accept a single props parameter which carries relevant sub-properties. Therefore, there isn’t much to be described within that TSDoc section. |

Promise&lt;any&gt;

Human-friendly information what the SDK methods returns.

## Remarks

In this section, we have been adding detailed information such as: \* what API middleware endpoint this method is calling, \* what SAP OCC API endpoints are being called as a result of using this method, \* when this method can be used and when it can’t (e.g. logged-in vs anonymous users), \* simply everything what helps with understanding how it works.

## Example

A short code snippet showing how to use the method. Usually we have more than one @<!-- -->example. We should strive for adding as many examples as possible here, with multiple param configurations.
