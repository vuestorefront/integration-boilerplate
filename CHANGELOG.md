## 21.04.2023 - Sergii

### Added

- Adjusted folder structure to follow agreed pattern
- Changed api-client exampleEndpoint to sync with the frontend example API call
- Added exampleApp placeholder to the frontend app folder
- Added script to run middleware and frontend apps:
  - npm start - runs frontend
  - npm run start:middleware - runs middleware 
  (these were separated, so the output from both applications can be seen in the terminal)
